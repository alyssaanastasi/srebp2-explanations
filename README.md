# srebp2-explanations

This is the repository for my summer research project consisting of applying Graph Neural Network (GNN) Explanation Methods to a GNN that is trained to predict whether a gene perturbation will have an effect on cellular and molecular phenotypes in the process of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. 

The files are as follows: 

- node_order.pickle
- SimpleGAT_1_model_lr_0.0001_dp_0.7.pth
- gnn_explainer.ipynb
